Before using it, obviously you need to install MathJax on your local site. For example, suppose the version 2.7.7 is downloaded and extracted to the folder \"media/MathJax-2.7.7\". Remember the folder \"media\" is the existing folder of Joomla. In this case, you need to enter the parameter value as \"media/MathJax-2.7.7\". The major version of your local installation should same as CDN major version due to conflicts between two different major versions. Also if the path to the local installation is empty, it fallbacks to CDN even if MathJax Source is chosen as local installation."

COM_JEXTBOXEQUATION_CONFIGURATION_DSC_MATHJAXCDNVERSION="A version number of MathJax which is used currenty. The version number should formatted as #.#.#, for example, \"2.7.7\" (no quotation marks). The version 2 is the stable major version of MathJax. If you need to use its latest development version, enter \"3.0.0\". In this case, the latest development version of MathJax is loaded on the front-end only. For the back-end or the editor button, the stable version 2 is used for previewing a math equation before inserting it into an article. Also in such case, local installation is inapplicable. Thus, we recommend you to use the version 2. If leave this field empty, the version 2.7.7 (default value) is loaded automatically."

COM_JEXTBOXEQUATION_CONFIGURATION_DSC_MATHJAXCONFIG="The configuration format depends from which version do you use. If empty, default configuration is used which is provided by the maintainer or the author."
